## Guardian News.

I decided to heavily concentrate on planning before attempting this weekend challenge.

Prior to writing any code, I played around with the guardian api, to see what it was capable of and what parameters it required etc.

I spent friday morning looking into promises and async functions, concentrating on the use of await that was brought out in Es6. This allowed me to use the fetch keyword instead of XML request.
