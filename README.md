# Guardian News Summary App.

I decided to heavily concentrate on planning before attempting this weekend challenge.

Prior to writing any code, I played around with the guardian api, to see what it was capable of and what parameters it required etc. It's documentation can be viewed at the following link:

I spent friday morning looking into promises and async functions, concentrating on the use of await that was brought out in Es6. This allowed me to use the fetch keyword instead of XML request.

## Deployment

I decided to deploy a BETA version of this project at the following address https://quicknews.imfast.io/

## Google Analytics

I decided to have a play around in which I built Google Analytics monitoring into the website. This can be shown below:
